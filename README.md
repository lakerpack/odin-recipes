# odin-recipes
This project is to build a website which will provite all the basic recipes a college freshman need!

This is written in HTML and will show that I have the basics down of creating my own boilerplate, understanding the function of <head> and <body> as well as how to utilize tags in general for paragraphs, images, and links.
